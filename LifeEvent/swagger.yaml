    The Life Event class represents an important event or situations in a citizen's life where public services may be required. Note the scope: an individual will encounter any number of 'events' in the general sense of the word. In the context of the CPSV-AP, the Life Event class only represents an event for which a Public Service is related. For example, a couple becoming engaged is not a CPSV-AP Life Event, getting married is, since only the latter has any relevance to public services.
