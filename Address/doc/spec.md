## List of properties  

<sup><sub>[*] If there is not a type in an attribute is because it could have several types or different formats/patterns</sub></sup>  
- `address[object]`: The mailing address  . Model: [https://schema.org/address](https://schema.org/address)	- `addressCountry[string]`: The country. For example, Spain  . Model: [https://schema.org/addressCountry](https://schema.org/addressCountry)  
	- `addressLocality[string]`: The locality in which the street address is, and which is in the region  . Model: [https://schema.org/addressLocality](https://schema.org/addressLocality)  
	- `addressRegion[string]`: The region in which the locality is, and which is in the country  . Model: [https://schema.org/addressRegion](https://schema.org/addressRegion)  
	- `district[string]`: A district is a type of administrative division that, in some countries, is managed by the local government    
	- `postOfficeBoxNumber[string]`: The post office box number for PO box addresses. For example, 03578  . Model: [https://schema.org/postOfficeBoxNumber](https://schema.org/postOfficeBoxNumber)  
	- `postalCode[string]`: The postal code. For example, 24004  . Model: [https://schema.org/https://schema.org/postalCode](https://schema.org/https://schema.org/postalCode)  
	- `streetAddress[string]`: The street address  . Model: [https://schema.org/streetAddress](https://schema.org/streetAddress)  
	- `streetNr[string]`: Number identifying a specific property on a public street    
- `addressArea[array]`: The name of a geographic area that groups Addresses. This would typically be part of a city, a neighbourhood or village, e.g. Montmartre. Address area is not an administrative unit. address ID Literal 0..*.. A globally unique identifier for each instance of an Address. The concept of adding a globally unique identifier for each instance of an address is a crucial part of the INSPIRE data spec. A number of EU countries have already implemented an ID (a UUID) in their Address Register/gazetteer, among them Denmark. OASIS xAL also includes an address identifier. It is the address Identifier that allows an address to be represented in a format other than INSPIRE whilst remaining conformant to the Core Vocabulary  - `addressID[array]`: A globally unique identifier for each instance of an Address. A globally unique identifier for each instance of an Address. The INSPIRE method of representing addresses is very detailed, designed primarily for use in databases of addresses. Whilst data that is published in full conformance with the INSPIRE data structure can be made available using the Core Location Vocabulary the reverse is not true since the Core Vocabulary allows much greater flexibility. Many datasets that include address data as one piece of information about something else are likely to have that data in simpler formats. These might be tailored to the specific need of the dataset, follow a national norm, or make use of a standard like vCard  - `adminUnitL1[array]`: The name of the uppermost level of the address, almost always a country. Best practice is to use the ISO 3166-1 code but if this is inappropriate for the context, country names should be provided in a consistent manner to reduce ambiguity. For example, either write 'France' or 'FRA' consistently throughout the dataset and avoid mixing the two. The Country controlled vocabulary from the Publications Office can be reused for this  - `adminUnitL2[array]`: The name of a secondary level/region of the address, usually a county, state or other such area that typically encompasses several localities. Values could be a region or province, more granular than level 1  - `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity  - `dateCreated[date-time]`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform  - `dateModified[date-time]`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform  - `description[string]`: A description of this item  - `fullAddress[array]`: The complete address written as a string. Use of this property is not recommended as it will suffer any misunderstandings that might arise through the breaking up of an address into its component parts. This property is analogous to vCard's label property but with two important differences: (1) formatting is not assumed so that, unlike vCard label, it may not be suitable to print this on an address label, (2) vCard's label has a domain of vCard Address; the fullAddress property has no such restriction. An example of a full address is 'Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France'  - `id[*]`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location[*]`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `locatorName[array]`: Proper noun(s) applied to the real world entity identified by the locator. The key difference between a locator and a locator name is that the latter is a proper name and is unlikely to include digits. For example, 'Shumann, Berlaymont' is a meeting room within the European Commission headquarters for which locator name is more appropriate than locator.  - `name[string]`: The name of this item  - `owner[array]`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `poBox[array]`: A location designator for a postal delivery point at a post office, usually a number. INSPIRE's name for this is 'postalDeliveryIdentifier' for which it uses the locator designator property with a type attribute of that name. This vocabulary separates out the Post Office Box for greater independence of technology. An example post office box number is '9383'  - `postCode[array]`: The code created and maintained for postal purposes to identify a subdivision of addresses and postal delivery points. Post codes are common elements in many countries' postal address systems. One of the many post codes of Paris is for example '75000'  - `postName[array]`: A name created and maintained for postal purposes to identify a subdivision of addresses and postal delivery points. Usually a city, for example 'Paris'  - `seeAlso[*]`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source[string]`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object  - `thoroughfare[array]`: The name of a passage or way through from one location to another.A thoroughfare is usually a street, but it might be a waterway or some other feature. For example, 'Avenue des Champs-Élysées'  - `type[string]`: It must be equal to Address  <!-- /30-PropertiesList -->
