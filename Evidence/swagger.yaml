    The Evidence class is defined in the Core Criterion and Core Evidence vocabulary (CCCEV) as any resource that can document or support a criterion response. It contains information that proves that a criterion requirement exists or is true, in particular evidences are used to prove that a specific criterion is met. Although the wording of the definition is different, the semantics are an exact match for CPSV's Input class which it replaces. Evidence can be any resource - document, artefact â€“ anything needed for executing the Public Service. In the context of Public Services, Evidence is usually administrative documents or completed application forms. A specific Public Service may require the presence of certain Evidence or combinations of Evidence in order to be delivered. In some cases, the Output of one service will be Evidence for another service. Such relationships should be described in the associated Rule(s).
